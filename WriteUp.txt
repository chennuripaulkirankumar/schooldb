Step1: Creates a new database named "SCHOOLDB" and then by usingthis database for subsequent operations.
Step2: Creates a table named "Students" with columns for student details given below,
StudentID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, and ClassID. StudentID is the primary key of this table, ensuring each student has a seperate identification.
Step3: Inserts multiple rows of data into the "Students" table, each representing a
student's information including StudentID, First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth,
and ClassID.
Step4: Creates a table named "Subjects" to store information about subjects. The
table has columns for SubjectID (primary key) and SubjectName.
Step5: Inserts rows into the "Subjects" table, representing different subjects
along with their corresponding IDs and names.
Step6: Creates a table named "Classes" to store information about classes. The
table has columns for ClassID (primary key) and ClassName.
Step7: Nonclustered indexes on specific columns in the respective tables, which
can help improve query performance when searching for data based on those
columns.
Step8: Finally, this code creates a database named "SCHOOLDB," defines tables
for student information, subjects, and classes, inserts data into these tables,
creates indexes for better performance, and then retrieves and displays the
given output stored data.
